         As a core team member of Design @ Columbia, I was able to aid the student-run organization's goal of fostering
          a strong design community at Columbia University. The organization hosts panels, holds workshops and many
          other similar collaborative events that are meant to target students of all disciplines who are interested in
          design.

         My role involved strategizing our organization's re-branding. This involved developing a new visual language
          for the organization. Working with the Marketing Coordinator Wendy Sung and Design Lead Laura Block, we
          drafted different languages and styles, using various iteration strategies.

         The design challenge assigned for the semester was a challenge to “design for density” in a world that is
          currently suffering from a pandemic. Our team’s territory was city nightlife, we were challenged to create
          some sort of intervention that completed some goal within this territory. We found through research that
          there is an opportunity to provide the necessary safety measures to optimize customer experience and revenue
          streams at nightlife establishments.

          Research showed us that as the COVID-19 pandemic causes a more regulated nightlife experience, bar owners
          were struggling to pay their employees and make rent. Attendance at bars and nightlife venues was declining
          and constrained. We discovered through interviews that the social landscape of bars has changed completely,
          and that customers were forced to compromise this social aspect in their night time outings.

          We reframed the idea with research and customer interviews in mind. We were able to create and reinforce an
          outdoor solution by implementing a space that brought multiple bars from a local area to New York City open streets.
          The idea was that an outdoor COVID-19 safe environment that attracted customers with a multi-bar experience would
          serve as a substitute for indoor bars and would bring back a bar-like atmosphere without the customers
          compromising their own safety.

         The solution showed BarHub is able to provide consistent experience that is exciting each visit, due to its
          changing bar variety and vibrant, safe  atmosphere. This experience was built with bar owners and staff in
          mind, in order to allow them to both advertise and sell their drinks at a satellite location.
