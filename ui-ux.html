          <h2>Covid Design Challenge</h2>
          <h2>April 2020</h2>
          <p>Due to COVID-19, in March of 2020, students everywhere were forced to disperse across the
            globe and leave their campuses, the Covid Design Challenge was conceived to gain ideas on how to maintain our community through virtual campus
            experiences. The three day design challenge was meant to address challenges to our mental health, motivation,
            concentration and resources as students.</p>

            At the outset, I was inspired by ambient loops that I often listened to that simulated the experience of
            being somewhere I wasn’t. I liked to listen to the ones where I was by the beach, listening to the crashing
            of waves or in a house that was experiencing heavy rain. The goal of these ambient loops is to soothe the
            user as well as provide the user the ability to simulate a space that is conducive to productivity.

            I began by cataloging various soundscapes around campus from my experience. I was able to organize and
            create descriptions of what soundbites would be prevalent in each of the spaces. For example, in one of my
            favorite outdoor study spots on the lawn in front of a popular library, it would be common to hear others
            running on grass, children playing and friends chattering. These soundscapes would help me to understand
            the different atmospheres that could be provided by a physical campus.

            The final design was a web application that was functional and allowed the user to choose from different
            spaces of different categories and listen in on a loop of ambient audio that simulates the atmosphere of
            that space. The application also appealed to those who hold certain spaces very dear to their hearts by
            allowing them to submit feedback for spaces they didn’t feel was quite right as well as the ability to
            create a space with precise soundbites and elements in the looping audio.

          This method of user testing allowed us to visually qualify data based on how users interacted with it. It proved to be
          useful in summarizing data and identifying problem areas that most users struggled with. This method was
          effective and gave useful qualitative and quantitative infromation about how our designs were interacted with.

          Our findings showed large sticking points on different ppages of the current site, and also showed some
          aspects to be improved on the redesign.
